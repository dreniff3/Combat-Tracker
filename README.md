# COMBAT TRACKER

A simple tool for helping Dungeon Masters manage tabletop RPG combat encounters, tracking initiative (fighter turn order) and each fighter's health points (HP), built using React. 

Features:

- Add Fighters to Combat by filling out form inputs for "Name", "Initiative", "Armor Class", and "Health" and clicking the "Add Fighter" button

- Move turn pointer forward to the next Fighter in Initiative order with a button click

- Tracks rounds

- Increment and decrement each Fighter's health points with button clicks

- Each Fighter's health points are represented visually as integers and as a "health bar" graphic

- Generate dice roll values with a dice roller that has inputs for the number of dice to roll and the number of sides you want the dice to have
